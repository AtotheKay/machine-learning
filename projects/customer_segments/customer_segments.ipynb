Next, you will consider how giving a label to each customer (which *segment* that customer belongs to) can provide for additional features about the customer data.

However, the distributor will only make this change in delivery service for customers that react positively. \n",

    "**Answer:** These changes will not affect all customers equally. Especially in Cluster 0 Fresh is much lower than average so it may be sufficient to deliver 3 days a week. If Cluster 0 represents super markets, these may have sufficient storage so that they can store goods from larger and less frequent deliveries.\n",
    "However, a restaurant or bakery has less storage and more fresh ingredients so in Cluster 1 it would be more difficult to change to a 3 days a week intervall.\n",

Looking at each clustor seperately ensures that the customer profiles testing variant A vs variant B are highly similar.\n",

Since each customer has a ***customer segment*** it best identifies with (depending on the clustering algorithm applied), we can consider *'customer segment'* as an **engineered feature** for the data.
